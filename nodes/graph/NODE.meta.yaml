id: graph
type: leaf
purpose: "Graph engine for manifest parsing, dependency resolution, and DAG operations"
invariants:
  - "Detect cycles in dependency graph"
  - "Topological sort must be deterministic"
  - "Manifest format must be compact (one line per node)"
  - "Support both leaf and composite node types"
budgets:
  token_cap: 10000
policies:
  allowed_paths:
    - "SRC/"
  checks:
    - "go test ./internal/graph/..."
